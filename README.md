# Seabird assemblages along the Munida transect, off Otago Peninsula, Aotearoa New Zealand

**This is a work in progress, meaning this repository will be in constant change...**

Can we define seabird assemblages based on water masses at coarse scale?

Here, we used Graeme Loh's seabird observation dataset, carried out during the Munida Time Series voyages, to explore this question. The 'Munida transect' runs bi-monthly a 65 km offshore transect departing from the Taiaroa Head (Otago Peninsula). The main goal of these transects is to collect samples to monitor ocean acidification, but it also sample several other biogeochemical markers. It is been going on since 1998, making the Munida transect one of the longest time-series on ocean acidification globally. 

The interesting feature about this transect, is that it crosses consistently the Subtropical and Subantarctic Waters and the Southland Front--depending on oceanographic conditions, it also cross Neritic Waters. Therefore, using seabird *in situ* observations while carrying out these voyages is a great setting to test if, even in 'small' scales (i.e. coarse scale, 1--100 km), seabird occurrence respond to water masses.

Seabird data spans from 2015 to 2023, and it records maximum number of individuals counted at once within 5 km 'stretches'.
